A browser extension that turns all elements on all websites "blocky" like in the old internet days. Effectively, it sets the border radius of all elements on a website to zero.

## Usage

### Stores

The extension is available to be added on Mozilla: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blocky-web-ext/.

The Chrome extension web store is not available yet, as it is pending review from Google.

### Manual Install

The extension can also manually be added to your browser.

1. Head over to the extensions page of your browser.
2. Enable developer mode
3. Clone or download and unzip the repository.
4. Upload the whole directory to add it as an unofficial extension

## Credit
